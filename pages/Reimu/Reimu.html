            <p>Shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, She has some spirit-power by nature, but lacks training. Her weapon is the mighty Yin-Yang Orb, but her control is somewhat unstable.</p>
            <p>But anyway, with her spirit-power, she got quite some skills.</p>
            <p>Her usual attacks -namely amulet-attacks, spirit-power discharging (霊撃 -Spirit strike-), melee skills- are useless to current enemies. She's in some trouble.</p>
            <p>Currently, she's the only person in the shrine. </p>

            <p>A shrine maiden of Hakurei Shrine, who possesses natural-born spiritual power but lacks training. She exterminates youkai by attacking with amulets, firing her spiritual power called Spiritual Attack and releasing the power of Yin-Yang Orb.
She's such an optimist that she doesn't worry at all even in this emergency, and believes she can solve all incidents with her power.</p>
            <p>This time, she (somehow) fights riding on the turtle. </p>

            <p>The shrine maiden of Hakurei Shrine, who has spiritual power by nature, lacks training. She attacks
                with amulets and, by releasing spiritual power, performs a "spiritual attack". Also, she
                exterminates youkai with the power of the "Yin-Yang Orbs".
                Her personality is optimistic. Lots of weird things happen around Reimu, but she enjoys them.</p>
            <p>As usual (for some reason), she fights on a turtle.</p>
            <p>Once again, thinking it's suspicious, she's excited. </p>
