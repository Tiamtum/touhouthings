        <div class="prologue">
            <p>Deep in the mountains in a country in the East, the Hakurei Shrine was mostly peaceful. The shrine maiden
                of
                the Hakurei Shrine, Reimu, was always getting wrapped up in strange circumstances (though it should be
                noted
                she was a bit strange herself), so her free time was when things were peaceful. </p>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Reimu:</span> "Ah, what am I going to do with all this time on my hands. I
                wonder when something exciting
                is going to happen."</blockquote>
            <p>When the protagonist is idle, something is required to happen. Reimu thought she'd get out of the shrine
                for
                a while instead of sweeping the garden, and so stumbled upon some ruins. </p>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Reimu:</span> "Wait, what are these ruins doing next to the shrine. They
                weren't there yesterday!!"
                (something happens!)</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Mima:</span> "Oh, Reimu. So you came, too."</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Reimu:</span> "Great, it's Mima. Hmm, actually, it looks like there's a lot
                of people here... What is it with this ruins, anyway?"</blockquote>
            <blockquote>...</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Mima:</span> "It's said that something is asleep deep in these ruins that
                will grant happiness to whoever
                comes to visit it."</blockquote>
            <p>Mima took out a folded piece of paper from her pocket. Reimu took it and unfolded it. This was written on
                the
                paper: </p>
            <blockquote>
                <em>The ancient ruins: "Fantasy Ruins"</em><br>
                <em>Grand opening, 10am today</em><br>
                <em>・・・・</em><br>
                <em>To you who visit the ruins, we present something to make</em><br>
                <em>you happy. Our sincere thanks to everyone who stops by.</em><br>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Reimu:</span> "Hm! "What's with these pamphlets? (How is this some sort of
                ancient prophecy?) How can ruins have a grand opening? And none of this was here yesterday! How can you
                all be taken in by something that's so obviously suspicious!?""</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Marisa:</span> "Hm, so Reimu's not interested. That must mean..."
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Reimu:</span> "...Who said I'm not interested? Er, actually, I'm pretty busy
                (not), but having ruins suddenly pop up here is a pain to deal with. I have my complaints, you know."
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Mima:</span> "Isn't it almost time for the grand opening? I don't see an
                entrance anywhere. I guess we'll have to wait for now."</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Reimu:</span> (Man, when did this... well, I guess this is pretty normal
                around here... huh?)... it looks like there's a notice posted over here."</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Marisa:</span> "Wow, really? Hey, what's it say?"</blockquote>
            <blockquote>

        <h3>Shrine Maiden Who Maintains Dreams and Traditions — Hakurei Reimu </h3>
        <div class="characterBio">
            <img src="./characters/reimu.png" style="display:inline" alt="">
            <span>
                <p>The shrine maiden of Hakurei Shrine, who has spiritual power by nature, lacks training. She attacks
                    with amulets and, by releasing spiritual power, performs a "spiritual attack". Also, she
                    exterminates youkai with the power of the "Yin-Yang Orbs".
                    Her personality is optimistic. Lots of weird things happen around Reimu, but she enjoys them.</p>
                <p>As usual (for some reason), she fights on a turtle.</p>
                <p>Once again, thinking it's suspicious, she's excited. </p>
            </span>
        </div>
        <h3>Spirit Who Leaves Fate to the Dream of Eternity — Mima </h3>
        <div class="characterBio">
            <img src="./characters/mima.png" style="display:inline" alt="">
            <span>
                <p>An evil spirit at Hakurei Shrine holding a grudge. However, after a long period as an evil spirit,
                    she has completely gotten rid of her malice, and now it has become her daily routine to poke fun at
                    Reimu.
                    Already she has become a divine (curse god) kind of presence of Hakurei Shrine, but her personality
                    is more human-like than a human's is. </p>
                <p>Once again, weird events are happening, and she's quite looking forward to it. </p>
            </span>

        <h3>A Being Made of Magic and Red Dreams — Kirisame Marisa </h3>
        <div class="characterBio">
            <img src="./characters/marisa.png" style="display:inline" alt="">
            <span>
                <p>An absolutely unrivaled magician who idolizes Mima as "Lady Mima". Aside from being unrivaled, she is a normal human being. She's just a very ordinary girl who can use a little ridiculous and powerful magic. She's a magician, so she's basically quite intelligent. However, she's not someone who would take a jaded view of the world or, with a cry of "Lowly humans!!", explode a cobalt bomb. </p>
                <p>This time, she was drawn to the magical power leaking from the fantastic ruins. </p>
            </span>
        </div>
        <h3>Hardworking Witch Who Dreams of Love — Ellen </h3>
        <div class="characterBio">
            <img src="./characters/ellen.png" style="display:inline" alt="">
            <span>
                <p><em>—Ellen is a magician who does not grow up. So, even though she has lived a long time, she doesn't remember well. Drop by drop, she will forget about things one after another.</em></p>
                <p><em>That's why she remains a child forever.</em> (from Ha__raki__no)</p>
                <p>That said, Ellen, despite all that, is still an impressive witch. That is, she has remained alive for a truly long time. </p>
                <p>Once again, it's fluffy and crackling with magic. </p>
            </span>
        </div>
        <h3>Princess Dreaming of Beauty in Danmaku — Kotohime </h3>
        <div class="characterBio">
            <img src="./characters/kotohime.png" style="display:inline" alt="">
            <span>
                <p>A princess who is always out of sync in some way. She doesn't know what sort of person a princess is because her personality is broken and she doesn't fit in very well. However, she has a sensibility deviating from ordinary people, and is a collector who wants to collect only things that people do not show interest in.</p>
                <p>In short, she is a (genuine) enthusiast. </p>
                <p>Why might she be heading to the ruins? (Perhaps on a whim.) </p>
            </span>
        </div>
        <h3>Maiden Poltergeist Who Lost Her Dreams — Kana Anaberal </h3>
        <div class="characterBio">
            <img src="./characters/kana.png" style="display:inline" alt="">
            <span>
                <p>A so-called poltergeist. Spawned from a girl with mental instability, she is one aspect of that girl. She usually lives in (haunts) a large Western-style mansion, but recently, the mansion's residents have gotten used to her and pay no attention at all to her, so she's thinking about moving soon. </p>
                <p>Subconsciously, without thinking, she came to observe the turbulent spot... </p>
            </span>

        <h3>Scientist Who Looks for Dreams — Asakura Rikako </h3>
        <div class="characterBio">
            <img src="./characters/rikako.png" style="display:inline" alt="">
            <span>
                <p>In this world, few people believe in science. Of course, magic is primary. Here, Rikako is one such truly rare devotee of science. She believes that there are always powers other than magical ones.</p>
                <p>And yet, this Rikako is also a magician and, furthermore, holds considerably mighty magical powers. Scientific abilities aside, if she used magic in earnest, she should be so strong that no one could handle her, but she hates magic and cannot take it seriously. </p>
                <p>These ruins, she had come to believe, were absolutely made by science, but ... </p>

        <div class="characterBio">
            <img src="./characters/chiyuri.png" style="display:inline" alt="">
            <span>
                <p>　A girl with a somewhat odd way with words. She's Yumemi's rather outspoken assistant; she seems to be able to speak frankly with her. She may look immature, but she's 15 (probably immature). She left graduate school and works as an assistant at a university. (In this world, you graduate from college at 11, and leave graduate school at 13.) </p>
                <p>She's specializing in comparative physics, so she's obviously pretty sharp. </p>
                <p>Right now her primary tasks are things like organizing the data Yumemi collects. </p>
            </span>

        <h3>Fantasy legend — Okazaki Yumemi</h3>
        <div class="characterBio">
            <img src="./characters/yumemi.png" style="display:inline" alt="">
            <span>
                <p>She teaches comparative physics at a university. She doesn't look like it, but she's already 18,
which is quite young to be a professor. In Yumemi's world, all the forces such as gravity, electromagnetism,
and atomic power have been resolved under a unified theory, which has been proven to explain all known forces in the world.
Yumemi believes there may be a force that doesn't fit in this theory - "magic". </p>
                <p>However, when she announced her theory to the academic community, she became a laughing stock.</p>
                <p>Yumemi came to this world to get even with the academy, but... </p>
