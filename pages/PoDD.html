        <h3>Prologue</h3>
        <div class="prologue">
            <p>Deep in the mountains in a country in the East, the Hakurei Shrine was mostly peaceful. The shrine maiden of
                the Hakurei Shrine, Reimu, was always getting wrapped up in strange circumstances (though it should be noted
                she was a bit strange herself), so her free time was when things were peaceful. </p>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Reimu:</span> "Ah, what am I going to do with all this time on my hands. I wonder when something exciting
                is going to happen."</blockquote>
            <p>When the protagonist is idle, something is required to happen. Reimu thought she'd get out of the shrine for
                a while instead of sweeping the garden, and so stumbled upon some ruins. </p>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Reimu:</span> "Wait, what are these ruins doing next to the shrine. They weren't there yesterday!!"
                (something happens!)</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Mima:</span> "Oh, Reimu. So you came, too."</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Reimu:</span> "Great, it's Mima. Hmm, actually, it looks like there's a lot of people here... What is it with this ruins, anyway?"</blockquote>
            <blockquote>...</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Mima:</span> "It's said that something is asleep deep in these ruins that will grant happiness to whoever
                comes to visit it."</blockquote>
            <p>Mima took out a folded piece of paper from her pocket. Reimu took it and unfolded it. This was written on the
                paper: </p>
            <blockquote>
                <em>The ancient ruins: "Fantasy Ruins"</em><br>
                <em>Grand opening, 10am today</em><br>
                <em>・・・・</em><br>
                <em>To you who visit the ruins, we present something to make</em><br>
                <em>you happy. Our sincere thanks to everyone who stops by.</em><br>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Reimu:</span> "Hm! "What's with these pamphlets? (How is this some sort of ancient prophecy?) How can ruins have a grand opening? And none of this was here yesterday! How can you all be taken in by something that's so obviously suspicious!?""</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Marisa:</span> "Hm, so Reimu's not interested. That must mean..."</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Reimu:</span> "...Who said I'm not interested? Er, actually, I'm pretty busy (not), but having ruins suddenly pop up here is a pain to deal with. I have my complaints, you know."</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Mima:</span> "Isn't it almost time for the grand opening? I don't see an entrance anywhere. I guess we'll have to wait for now."</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Reimu:</span> (Man, when did this... well, I guess this is pretty normal around here... huh?)... it looks like there's a notice posted over here."</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Marisa:</span> "Wow, really? Hey, what's it say?"</blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <em>Inside the Fantasy Ruins</em><br>
                <em>Capacity: 1 person</em><br><br>
                <em>The capacity must be strictly observed.</em><br>
                <em>If the capacity is exceeded, then</em><br>
                <em>we can no longer guarantee the existence</em><br>
                <em>of these ruins in this dimension</em><br>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Reimu:</span> " ........ ?"</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Mima:</span> " ... so, that means ... "</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">Marisa:</span> "fufufu ... "</blockquote>
            <blockquote><span class="name">All together:</span> "The battle is on!!!"</blockquote>
